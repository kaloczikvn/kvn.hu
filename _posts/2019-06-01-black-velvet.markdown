Wordpress and WooCommerce based e-commerce website for a local hair salon.

<!--more-->

I created a custom theme for Wordpress and WooCommerce for "Black Velvet Fodrászat" in Győr. Their main goal was to sell hair and skin care products.

Making and designing a basic e-commerce site is easy most of the time but I had a really great challenge with this one. The client wanted to create a system to diagnose hair problems and suggest products based on the information the user gave. It was a fun but hard experience.
