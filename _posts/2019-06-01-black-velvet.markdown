I developed a Wordpress and WooCommerce-based e-commerce website for a local hair salon. The website enables customers to browse services, book appointments, and purchase hair products online.

Making and designing a basic e-commerce site is usually easy, but I had a unique and challenging experience with this project. The client had a specific request to create a system that could diagnose hair problems and recommend products based on the user's input. Although it was a fun project, it presented significant technical and design challenges that required me to use my problem-solving skills.
