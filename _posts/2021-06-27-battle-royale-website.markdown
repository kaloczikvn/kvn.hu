A blog & landing page for the Bf3: Battle Royale mod.

Bf3: Battle Royale is a Battlefield 3 modification which aims to bring the last man standing game-mode to Bf3. I was a project lead on this mod.

You can watch the trailer here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1yw5zJxUKE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1yw5zJxUKE)

Sadly the project is on hold currently so we might not even release the website with the updated landing page, but you can visit the devblog here:
