I created a blog and landing page for the Bf3: Battle Royale mod, which is a Battlefield 3 modification that aims to bring the last man standing game-mode to Bf3. As a project lead on this mod, I was responsible for overseeing the development process, and contributed to the gameplay and UI aspects of the mod.

Sadly, the project is currently on hold, so we may not even release the website with the updated landing page. However, you can still visit the devblog here:
