I created and published the first website for Kollégiumi Stúdió, a student team for aspiring sound engineers at Széchenyi István University (Győr). Four years later, I decided to revisit the project and create a new website from scratch using ReactJS.

The original website was a basic HTML + CSS page with Bootstrap 3 as the framework. To simplify the new website, I abandoned the custom PHP backend I had created for the original version. Instead, I opted to use GitHub and store all information in JSON files. This made updating the website much easier without having to rebuild it entirely.
