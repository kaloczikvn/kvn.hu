Kollégiumi Stúdió is a student team for wannabe sound engineers in Széchenyi István University (Győr). I made and published my first ever website for them and I wanted to revisit it 4 years later.

The first website was a basic HTML + CSS webpage using Bootstrap 3 as the base. The new website is all handmade and it uses ReactJS.

For the old website I made my own custom backend with PHP, but in the end I ditched that, as it was an overkill for this project. I ended up using GitHub and we store everything in JSON files, this was it is easy to update information on the website without rebuilding it.
