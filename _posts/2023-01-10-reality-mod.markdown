I designed and created a website for Bf3: Reality Mod in 2023, which is a Battlefield 3 modification focused on team play, communication, and combined arms, set in real-world conflicts starting from the end of the Cold War to modern-day conflicts. Additionally, I contributed to the in-game UI design.
