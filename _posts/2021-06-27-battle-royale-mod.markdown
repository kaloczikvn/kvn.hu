Bf3: Battle Royale was a Battlefield 3 modification project, for which I served as a project lead. Our goal was to introduce the last man standing game-mode to Bf3. Our team consisted of 5 programmers, each assigned to different tasks, such as developing the circle mechanism and looting. My main focus was on the gameplay and UI design.
