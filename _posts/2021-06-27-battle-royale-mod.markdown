Bf3: Battle Royale is a Battlefield 3 modification which aims to bring the last man standing game-mode to Bf3. I was a project lead on this mod.

We had 5 programmers on the team for various tasks, some of the worked on the circle mechanism, some worked on the looting. I mostly worked on the gameplay and the UI.

You can read more about the mod here:
